==Abstract==

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">The Philippines has been adopting the Automated Election System after years of adhering and relying on the Manual Voting System. It has been proven that the process became more efficient and gener-ates results in a lesser time frame. However, complications are still evident in present time. For in-stance, the possibility of electoral fraud still continues to persist through the existence of a secret server in the last presidential election. This study aims to propose a technical solution that would elim-inate the possibility of secret servers by implementing a public key infrastructure as security measures for the transmission of votes on the server-level.</p>

==Introduction==

===Background of the Problem===

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">After years of having a manual voting system, the Philippines have finally adopted an Automated Elec-tion System (AES) in 2010. This was mandated by Republic Act No. 9369 which is the Amended Elec-tions Automated Law. The law stated that there would be paper-based election system defined as “a type of automated election system that uses paper ballots, records, and counts votes, tabulates, con-solidates, canvases, and transmits electronically the results of the vote counts.” (Angkaya, 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">By standards, the new technology should be significantly more accurate and reliable for the voters; however, there were still some problems that might prove the acquired AES otherwise. For instance, the current automated election system with SMARTMATIC uses compact flash (CF) cards for the configuration of the Precinct Count Optical Scan machines in different provinces. These CF cards are pre-loaded with the precinct’s ballot depending on its specific geographical data. Then the same CF cards will also be the ones to store the data of the votes of the people. To look at it clearly, the cards are pre-loaded and will also be the storage of the votes and elections results. Now, this situation gives candidates, who want to sabotage the election, an easy time to manipulate the data in the system be-cause it can definitely be intercepted through physically tampering with these so-called CF cards. The study aims to find a way to reduce electoral fraud in the counting and transmission part of the auto-mated election system in order to achieve an indeed accurate and reliable system.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">The Automated Election Systems in the Philippines follows a sequence of process. Focusing on the counting and transmission module of the system, the process starts when the polling precincts closes on the election day. The PCOS machines transmit the vote counts or election returns to the corre-sponding servers and canvassing centers. It is done chronologically with a hierarchical structure com-posed of the precinct level, municipal level, provincial level, regional level, and national level. From the PCOS machines, the ERs are transmitted to the central server, to a transparency server, and to the municipal board of canvassers (MBOC). From the MBOC, the results are brought to the provincial board of canvassers (PBOC) or the regional board of canvassers (RBOC), where the results are collect-ed and then transmitted to the national board of canvassers (NBOC), where the results for national positions are canvassed. The MBOC and PBOC also separately send ERs to the central server. Moreo-ver, the canvassing system processes the ERs that were transmitted. Public telecommunication net-works are assigned to be the main channel when transmitting the ERs. There are back-up plans made if the network fails to accomplish its task. For example, transmissions can be made via satellite to avoid delays when problems occur.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">During the course of the counting and transmission of ERs, electoral fraud is inevitable. There are a lot of issues concerning the effectivity and efficiency of the machine during the elections. For instance, the current voting system does not incorporate digital signature when transmitting the election re-turns from precincts to canvassers even if it is stated in the law. According to the republic act 9369 sec-tion 22, “The election returns transmitted electronically and digitally signed shall be considered as offi-cial election results and shall be used as the basis for the canvassing of votes and the proclamation of a candidate”. This means that BEIs are required to digitally sign the ERs that would be transmitted. As stated in the law, the ERs that would be recognized officially are the ones that were authenticated and validated by the administrators. However, during the past three automated election system, the AES failed to meet the requirements prescribed by the law. A possible reason is that the system being used allows humans to intervene in the process of the election. This is one of the reasons why it is easy for any unofficial institutions/organizations to ambush and manipulate the elections. For exam-ple, in Mindanao armed men prevented the citizens from voting. They controlled the precinct and made it impossible for the voters to cast their votes. Many eye witnesses claim that a wholesale ballot shading was conducted. Meaning only the same people casted many ballots inside the PCOS machine without the control of the BEIs. Without the existence of a digital signature provided by an authenti-cated agency, the election returns being transferred would still be considered not reliable because the digital signatures are used to verify the validity of the transmitted ERs. A public key infrastructure is practiced to guarantee that the votes are secured during transmission. A system should be designed to ensure that before transmitting the votes, ERs are equipped with digital signatures. Another solu-tion that could be made to reduce the chances of this type of cheating is to incorporate the idea of GPS or global positional system in the machine used in the elections. GPS tracking uses both the time and location components that could provide data to the users. It is an effective way of navigating where the machine should be placed or located via a system the receives data from the satellites in space.</p>

===Statement of the Problem===

<p style="text-indent:30px">How can the Philippine automated election system secure the transmission of election returns on the server-level?</p>

===Objectives===

====General Objectives====
<ul>
	<li>To know the vital issues currently present in the transmission of the votes</li>
	<li>To propose a system that would prevent electoral fraud in the transmission of votes in the automated election system</li>
</ul>

====Specific Objectives====

</ul>

===Significance of the Study===

<p style="text-align: justify">The findings of this research will benefit the following key players:</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">To the Filipino Citizens</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">This study will benefit the Filipino citizens for ensuring the security of the casted votes. Also, it would prevent malicious individuals from manipulating the votes. Although the nature of automation easily provoke fear to ignorance of using technology, this study will educate some of those users that still lack computer literacy foundation. Indeed education can bridge the existing gaps and even remove the unnecessary fear from automation. This will leave the citizens better equipped for the future of the Philippine automated election system.</p>	
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">To the COMELEC</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">This research would significantly contribute to the goal of the COMELEC to conduct a fair and transparent election. Considering the impact of the elections in the overall condition and future of the Philippines, it is important to make sure that the voters’ choice reflect the outcome of the election. To do that, the system should be able to prevent and mitigate electoral fraud while ensuring that the voters have casted their votes in a way that is convenient and voter-friendly. This study will aim to determine the most appropriate methods to achieve the kind of system that does not manipulate the vote of the people in any way through data gathering and research. In this manner, the people will be knowledgeable about how the system works and be an informed and wise voters themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">To the Future Researchers</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">As the Philippines adjust to this kind of voting system, more and more developers would also contribute to the AES aspect of software development. In that case, the system that would be created can serve as a guide and inspiration for other developers who would want to pursue the prospect of automated election system too. </p>

==Scope and Limitation==

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">The scope of the study would only include the issues and possible solutions for the security of the transmission of election returns on the server-level of the automated election system in the Phil-ippines. Further study on the other parts of the automated election system will no longer be covered.</p>

==Review of Related Literature==
===Related Literature===

====Automated Election Law====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">According to the Commission on Elections, “The Republic Act No. 9369 is an act authorizing the Commission on Elections to use an automated election system in… subsequent national and local electoral exercises to encourage transparency, credibility, fairness and accuracy of elections…”. (Retrieved on April 10, 2016/ http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=References/RelatedLaws/ElectionLaws/AutomatedElection/RA9369).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">One section of the law states that the minimum conditions provided should be met by the automated election system which includes the granting of Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail. It allows the voters to check if the votes were cast precisely and to detect the possibility of having electoral fraud or system malfunction. Also, the law requires the system to have documents that can verify the correctness of the reported results that are provided by the system itself. Moreover, The Commission on Election (Comelec) is the institution liable for implementing and assuring that the system’s minimum conditions are met. (Atienza, 2016, par. 2-4).</p>

====Description of the System====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">Before officially starting the elections, there are preparations made in order to achieve a well-prepared and organized Automated Election System (AES). The very superior part of the AES is the Election Management System (EMS). Its main job is to prepare the automation polls and to manage pre-election data that includes the number of registered voters, candidate details and other information that is essential for the election. The preparation of ballots and the file configurations needed in the Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) machines are also under the jurisdiction of the EMS. (Bueza, 2015, par. 4-8).
In the Philippine setting, the automated election system relies on the PCOS machines. However, a claim by Ellorin (2013) suggests that the Philippine elections is not 100% automated because paper ballots are still being utilized up to present time. (par. 3).
</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">In order to successfully cast the votes, there is a series of steps that needs to be followed. First, a voter manually fills out a ballot by properly darkening the oval beside the names of the candidates they prefer. After selecting and shading the ballot, the voter must insert the ballot into the PCOS machine. Based on the readings of the shaded oval, the machine will then record and store the votes cast by the voters in an internal memory. In case of data loss, a removable memory card is used to back up the results and applications in the PCOS machine. The security features of the machine is taken into consideration to prevent fraud and malicious attacks aiming to sabotage the results of the automated election system. Each machine is equipped with a unique security key and verification PIN code. Before starting the elections, the Board of Election Inspectors is given the task to input the key and code for authentication. After the PIN is entered, the machine’s initialization report is generated. It should indicate that there are currently zero entries which means that the machine has no data yet. When the voting starts, the LCD screen of the machine will show the continuing count of the number of votes submitted. At the end of the voting period, the Board of Election Inspectors will commence the digital counting process and prepare the printing of Election Returns. In transmitting the results, the ER is sent to the Comelec hub and the PCOS will be able to print copies of the ER for the national and local positions. Additionally, a statistical report and log is produced for supplementary documentation. (Ellorin, 2013, par. 1-19).</p>

====Issues of the Current Technology====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">Smartmatic is a corporation that specializes in the design of complex “purpose-specific” technologies and is known to provide and create voting systems. The Precinct Count Optical Scan (PCOS) that the Comelec uses for the national and local electoral practices were purchased from Smartmatic for a large sum of money. However, despite its marketing value many experts claimed and observed various defects in the PCOS machine. Renato Reyes, a KontraDaya advocate, said that during the 2013 elections a large number of PCOS machines failed to transmit its results. “No real and credible review or audit of the source code, the software that runs the PCOS machines, was ever done”, added Reyes. The delayed consignment of the source code resulted from the fact that Dominion, the owner of the source code, and Smartmatic had already ended their legal agreements. The source code consists of the sets of instructions for the PCOS machine. Due to the ended agreement many controversies against Smartmatic began to surface which includes there right to sell the PCOS machines. Another problem that has been noted is the ability of the machine to display and to provide assurance that the votes were properly and accurately recorded. (Automated Failures, 2014).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">A test conducted by SysTest Labs discovered that there were many programming errors in Smartmatic’s programs that possibly caused the technical errors during the elections. Evidently, there were a significant number of tabulation errors displayed in the public website of Comelec because of the system flaw. The SysTest Labs is the institution responsible for testing the machine’s operations in accordance with the RA-9369. However, they failed to properly conduct the tests resulting to uncertainties with regards to the machine’s ability to operate. The most questionable error reported was the processing of the database transactions. Such errors can cause the system to stop running or to produce wrong results. According to the Comelec, transmissions of votes were done via the internet to their corresponding destinations. If the internet transmission fails, then the election returns (ER) or vote results are hand-carried by the Board of Election Inspectors (BEI) to the appropriate canvassing centers. Moreover, if partial failure occurs then the BEI will fail to notice that there is a failure in transmitting the votes thus considering the error successful. This is commonly observed during the transmission to the Consolidation Canvassing System (CCS) that is divided into three namely, the municipal, provincial and Comelec. (Manalastas, 2010, pp.1-5).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">A study by Manalastas (2012) on the Comelec public access website revealed that there is evidently a large scale of transmission errors. Computer programs were used to count the number of precincts that did not have ERs. From a total of 76, 472 precincts only 67,162 or 87.8% has the normal number of ERs. On the other hand, 8,939 or 11.7% failed to transmit their accumulated votes and 371 or 0.5% of the precincts recorded few voters. However, in those 67,162 precincts that had normal transmission 25,888 were reported to have missing data. (pp. 1-5).</p>

====Automation and Electoral Fraud====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">According to Vitangcol III (2010), “Electronic voting is a general term encompassing several different types of voting, embracing both electronic means of casting a vote and electronic means of counting votes”. He claimed that the Philippines’ AES is practicing the “document ballot voting system”, wherein paper ballots are marked by hand but tallied electronically. Additionally, he quoted that “One of the basic democratic principles of election is ‘voting in secret and counting in public’”. However, the use of PCOS machines in counting electoral votes cancels out the second principle. (Retrieved on April 10, 2016/ http://www.philstar.com/starweek-magazine/564937/look-automation-and-electoral-fraud).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">The transparency of vote count is for the right of the people to view important information. The 1987 Constitution states that:</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify"><i>“The right of the people to information on matters of public concern shall be recognized. Access to official records, and to documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions, as well as to government research data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to such limitations as may be provided by law. “</i></p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">Additionaly, Article 2 Section 28 states that:</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify"><i>“Subject to reasonable conditions prescribed by law, the State adopts and implements a policy of full public disclosure of all its transactions involving public interest. Therefore, it is very clear from the Constitution that transparency is an important pillar of Philippine democracy. “</i></p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">(Citizen Reform Agenda 2010: Agenda on Anti-Corruption For Candidates and Political Parties of the Upcoming 2010 Elections, 2010, p.5)</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">Furthermore, there are problems that may occur during the elections and one example is electoral fraud. It is defined as an illegal obstruction with the entire process of the election that greatly affects the vote counts. There are many forms of electoral fraud as mentioned by Vitangcol III (2010) that negatively impacts the view of the citizens towards the credibility and validity of the PCOS machine. First, the disenfranchisement of voters which is the act of accidentally or intentionally making it difficult for legitimate voters to cast their votes. This can be done in many possible ways like switching the ballots to be delivered to the precincts or the tampering of the bar code present in the ballot in order to sabotage the votes of others. Next, confusing ballot design may affect the minds of the voters when casting their votes. The design of the ballot is important because a study shows that the first candidate’s name displayed in the ballot can accumulate an additional three percent of the total votes cast in their favor. The current ballot design is said to be inconvenient for the voters specifically the visually impaired merely because of the small font size. Moreover, the predominant use of the English language in the ballot and the placing of the oval to be shaded also adds confusion for some voters particularly those who have lower literacy. Confusing ballot design and disenfranchisement of voters may result to vote padding or vote shaving. Another form of fraud is the tampering of election results. Major technical issues are still left unresolved. For instance, the vulnerability of the machine to hackers because of poor security architecture design. A spokesperson of the Comelec stated, “I am not saying that the system cannot be hacked. No system is 100 percent hack-proof. I am just saying that we have made sure that the system will not be hacked”. They further claimed that the possibility of hacking the PCOS system is very slim because of the tiny span of online activity being done. However, there is no assurance that the other canvassing centers are also online for a short span of time. Hackers are known to be motivated by challenges that lets them develop systems that can paralyze or halt activities in another system. In reality, the institutions responsible in handing the AES do not have an effective security management to protect the important data being transmitted and collected from these hackers. (Retrieved on April 10, 2016/ http://www.philstar.com/starweek-magazine/564937/look-automation-and-electoral-fraud).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">A result of the study conducted by Manuel L. Calimlim stated that, based from expert’s analysis and the  key players’ interview that are associated with the automated election system the IT related factors contributing to awareness of the people with regards to electoral fraud are the PCOS machine glitch, faulty  CF cards, data transmission, inconsistencies in audit logs, absence of digital signature resulting to concerns mainly on security, and unavailability of the source code making it impossible to undergo inspection. (Preliminary Findings on IT Related Factors That Contribute to Public Perceptions of Election Fraud in the Automated Election System in the Philippines, pp.10-15).</p>

====Technology Assessment====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">There are many areas that needs to be taken into consideration to fully implement the use of an online platform on the election system in the Philippines. The use of AES has its advantages and disadvantages.  </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">It is already given that in order to conduct an automated election system there should be the availability of computers and other devices that are used as a medium during the elections. Although it can cost a large amount of money, it can still cut cost on other expenses like the labor cost. It can be a good investment considering the long term returns that is generated. Hardware and software investments and training for electoral workers should be taken into account. With the implementation of AES it is expected to provide efficient processing of tasks and results. Compared to voting manually, automated system has its perks. Instead of manually counting votes that were submitted the system will automatically count votes faster and accurately without the need of human intervention. The system’s mechanism reduces the probability of having errors due to fraud and tampering. Also, improved ability to identify and prevent frauds is possible. The system is equipped with encryption algorithms to store and transmit voted from the machine to the tabulation centers setting the integrity of the elections higher. On the other hand, a disadvantage of the AES is its vulnerability when people starts to enter the system without permission. Angkaya (2011) said, “Hackers are the number one enemy of this system”. Additionally, they try to manipulate computer programs in any possible way. Technology has its weakness and no system is 100% fool proof.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">There is an undergoing debate about the feasibility of having an automated election in the Philippines. For the past years, Filipinos were capable of voting even those who are illiterate. With proper technology and mechanisms there is a chance that the election system of the Philippines would be purely automated. However, problems may occur along the way. In conducting an automated system, electricity is an important factor. Some rural areas are still having problem with the adequate amount of supply of electricity. Also, a number of personnel is expected to be deployed all around the country in order to troubleshoot and install the system. Senator Gordon stated that the automated elections would be possible if there would be a national ID system based on biometrics that the voters will provide. A check and balance is created because the system is not fool proof making it vulnerable to frauds. The presence of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trails ensures the credibility and security of the votes being submitted in the machine. Lastly, protection of the source code is a priority to avoid hackers from entering the system. (Angkaya, 2010, chap. 4).</p>

===Related Studies===

====HALALAN====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">University of the Philippines-Diliman implemented an automated voting for its local student university-wide elections. The voting system is known for its name “Halalan”. It does not utilize any paper ballots and is completely automated. The system was developed by the UP Linux Users Group (UnPLUG). The development started upon seeing the long paper ballots present in the university, thinking about the possibility of having an automated election system. The most notable feature of the Halalan system is the utilization of open source software. In order to run, it also needs network of computers connected to a web server and a database server. The voting that occurred in UP Diliman that started using the Halalan system begins in the following steps. A student goes to a precinct and presents his or her student ID. Once the ID is verified by the poll clerk, the voter is given a password from a listing of generated passwords. The voter goes to the computer and logs in his or her student number and the provided password. In the event of successfully logging in, an online ballot is displayed. The voter clicks on the boxed beside the names of the candidates and parties of their choice. The voter also has the choice to review his or her online ballot before submitting and confirming. The tallying of votes is continuously being accumulated until the end of the election. The Halalan system allows fast tabulation of votes if implemented accordingly. There is no need in spending hundreds of machined only designed for the purpose of reading a paper ballot. The expenses are devoted in buying personal computers or laptops that can be used for other purposes. The Halalan system may also encounter problems thus requiring a set of specific conditions. Highly stable computer network infrastructure should be present to ensure that all computers are connected to the central server at all times. There are also instances wherein the computer crashes and loses data. Another hurdle observed is the requirement that all voters must possess a degree of computer literacy in order to utilized electronic devices to its extent. (Reyes, 2010, par. 1-10).</p>

====PATAS====

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">The Commission on Elections (Comelec) held a mock election that utilizes its proposed hybrid election system known as Precinct Automation Tallying System or PATas at the Bacoor National High School. When using PATaS, voting is done manually and once the ballots are filled, it is then dropped in a ballot box. The counting of votes is also done manually by tallying. Augusto Lagman, an IT expert who proposed the idea of the hybrid election system, said that manual counting of the votes eliminates the possibility of result manipulation. "The problem with our current system — PCOS —  is that right from the first step, we don't know if they (the votes) are being counted correctly”, Lagman added. Moreover, the hybrid system will help the people avoid accidental and intentional errors during transmission. It can also lessen the number of invalid or rejected votes as shown in a comparison between the 2013 automated election and the 2010 manual elections.. In the 2013 automated elections, there were four million votes declared invalid compared to 2.1 million rejected votes in the 2010 manual elections. On the other hand, in PATaS the only automation part happens during the transmission of the total precinct count to the main servers. Lagman also claimed that by implementing the said system the government can cut down on the election system expenses. (Retrieved on April 12, 2016/ http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/06/27/Commission-on-Elections-Comelec-holds-mock-elections-tests-hybrid-system.html). </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">However, The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has rejected the proposal for a hybrid manual and automated election system in the 2016 national polls. Christian Robert Lim, Comelec's senior commissioner, cited the following reasons: the PATAS will cost more compared to the optical mark reader (OMR) system, whether it is leased or purchased; PATAS will require amendment of existing laws or enactment of new laws; PATAS is time-consuming, taxing and prone to human error; and the PATAS software still needs to be developed.

====TAPAT====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">TAPAT (Transparent Election System) was developed by Filipino IT group led by Edmundo Casiño, former president of the Philippine Computer Society (PCS), together with AES Watch. The alternative election system aims to make an election technology that is familiar to Filipino voters through the use of Lotto-type ballots. Moreover, a GPS-precinct-specific tablet will be used to scan and transmit the votes instead of the PCOS machines. However, after the said machine scans the ballot, it will issue a receipt called Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) that allows voters to double-check the votes that the machine read and the voters casted. According to the developers, TAPAT will only take a maximum 3 minutes per voter and will only cost around a billion pesos.

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">In 2015, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) tried the TAPAT voting system and was actually satisfied with the results except for the receipt issuance. They argued that this would only provoke voters to sell their votes but the IT group said that the VVPAT will be dropped by the voters together with the official ballots at the precinct. Due to time constraints however, the COMELEC thought it was a bit too late to integrate the system in the 2016 election but encouraged the developers to continue the improvements and tests for the promising election system.
