==Abstract==

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">The Philippines has been adopting the Automated Election System after years of adhering and relying on the Manual Voting System. It has been proven that the process became more efficient and gener-ates results in a lesser time frame. However, complications are still evident in present time. For in-stance, the possibility of electoral fraud still continues to persist through the existence of a secret server in the last presidential election. This study aims to propose a technical solution that would elim-inate the possibility of secret servers by implementing a public key infrastructure as security measures for the transmission of votes on the server-level.</p>

==Introduction==

===Background of the Problem===

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">After years of having a manual voting system, the Philippines have finally adopted an Automated Elec-tion System (AES) in 2010. This was mandated by Republic Act No. 9369 which is the Amended Elec-tions Automated Law. The law stated that there would be paper-based election system defined as “a type of automated election system that uses paper ballots, records, and counts votes, tabulates, con-solidates, canvases, and transmits electronically the results of the vote counts.” (Angkaya, 2011).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">By standards, the new technology should be significantly more accurate and reliable for the voters; however, there were still some problems that might prove the acquired AES otherwise. For instance, the current automated election system with SMARTMATIC uses compact flash (CF) cards for the configuration of the Precinct Count Optical Scan machines in different provinces. These CF cards are pre-loaded with the precinct’s ballot depending on its specific geographical data. Then the same CF cards will also be the ones to store the data of the votes of the people. To look at it clearly, the cards are pre-loaded and will also be the storage of the votes and elections results. Now, this situation gives candidates, who want to sabotage the election, an easy time to manipulate the data in the system be-cause it can definitely be intercepted through physically tampering with these so-called CF cards. The study aims to find a way to reduce electoral fraud in the counting and transmission part of the auto-mated election system in order to achieve an indeed accurate and reliable system.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align:justify">The Automated Election Systems in the Philippines follows a sequence of process. Focusing on the counting and transmission module of the system, the process starts when the polling precincts closes on the election day. The PCOS machines transmit the vote counts or election returns to the corre-sponding servers and canvassing centers. It is done chronologically with a hierarchical structure com-posed of the precinct level, municipal level, provincial level, regional level, and national level. From the PCOS machines, the ERs are transmitted to the central server, to a transparency server, and to the municipal board of canvassers (MBOC). From the MBOC, the results are brought to the provincial board of canvassers (PBOC) or the regional board of canvassers (RBOC), where the results are collect-ed and then transmitted to the national board of canvassers (NBOC), where the results for national positions are canvassed. The MBOC and PBOC also separately send ERs to the central server. Moreo-ver, the canvassing system processes the ERs that were transmitted. Public telecommunication net-works are assigned to be the main channel when transmitting the ERs. There are back-up plans made if the network fails to accomplish its task. For example, transmissions can be made via satellite to avoid delays when problems occur.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">During the course of the counting and transmission of ERs, electoral fraud is inevitable. There are a lot of issues concerning the effectivity and efficiency of the machine during the elections. For instance, the current voting system does not incorporate digital signature when transmitting the election re-turns from precincts to canvassers even if it is stated in the law. According to the republic act 9369 sec-tion 22, “The election returns transmitted electronically and digitally signed shall be considered as offi-cial election results and shall be used as the basis for the canvassing of votes and the proclamation of a candidate”. This means that BEIs are required to digitally sign the ERs that would be transmitted. As stated in the law, the ERs that would be recognized officially are the ones that were authenticated and validated by the administrators. However, during the past three automated election system, the AES failed to meet the requirements prescribed by the law. A possible reason is that the system being used allows humans to intervene in the process of the election. This is one of the reasons why it is easy for any unofficial institutions/organizations to ambush and manipulate the elections. For exam-ple, in Mindanao armed men prevented the citizens from voting. They controlled the precinct and made it impossible for the voters to cast their votes. Many eye witnesses claim that a wholesale ballot shading was conducted. Meaning only the same people casted many ballots inside the PCOS machine without the control of the BEIs. Without the existence of a digital signature provided by an authenti-cated agency, the election returns being transferred would still be considered not reliable because the digital signatures are used to verify the validity of the transmitted ERs. A public key infrastructure is practiced to guarantee that the votes are secured during transmission. A system should be designed to ensure that before transmitting the votes, ERs are equipped with digital signatures. Another solu-tion that could be made to reduce the chances of this type of cheating is to incorporate the idea of GPS or global positional system in the machine used in the elections. GPS tracking uses both the time and location components that could provide data to the users. It is an effective way of navigating where the machine should be placed or located via a system the receives data from the satellites in space.</p>

===Statement of the Problem===

<p style="text-indent:30px">How can the Philippine automated election system secure the transmission of election returns on the server-level?</p>

===Objectives===

====General Objectives====
<ul>
	<li>To know the vital issues currently present in the transmission of the votes</li>
	<li>To propose a system that would prevent electoral fraud in the transmission of votes in the automated election system</li>
</ul>

====Specific Objectives====
<ul>
	<li>To provide a technical solution that eliminates the possibility of existence of secret servers through the use of a public key infrastructure as security mechanism</li>
</ul>

===Significance of the Study===

<p style="text-align: justify">The findings of this research will benefit the following key players:</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">To the Filipino Citizens</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">This study will benefit the Filipino citizens for ensuring the security of the casted votes. Also, it would prevent malicious individuals from manipulating the votes. Although the nature of automation easily provoke fear to ignorance of using technology, this study will educate some of those users that still lack computer literacy foundation. Indeed education can bridge the existing gaps and even remove the unnecessary fear from automation. This will leave the citizens better equipped for the future of the Philippine automated election system.</p>	
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">To the COMELEC</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">This research would significantly contribute to the goal of the COMELEC to conduct a fair and transparent election. Considering the impact of the elections in the overall condition and future of the Philippines, it is important to make sure that the voters’ choice reflect the outcome of the election. To do that, the system should be able to prevent and mitigate electoral fraud while ensuring that the voters have casted their votes in a way that is convenient and voter-friendly. This study will aim to determine the most appropriate methods to achieve the kind of system that does not manipulate the vote of the people in any way through data gathering and research. In this manner, the people will be knowledgeable about how the system works and be an informed and wise voters themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">To the Future Researchers</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">As the Philippines adjust to this kind of voting system, more and more developers would also contribute to the AES aspect of software development. In that case, the system that would be created can serve as a guide and inspiration for other developers who would want to pursue the prospect of automated election system too. </p>

==Scope and Limitation==

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align: justify">The scope of the study would only include the issues and possible solutions for the security of the transmission of election returns on the server-level of the automated election system in the Philippines. Further study on the other parts of the automated election system will no longer be covered.</p>

====How does the current automated election system work?====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">On election day, as the polls close, the BEI immediately administers the transmission of the votes or election returns via the PCOS machines equipped with modems to the servers and canvassing centers The Electronic Results Transmission Service is responsible for the transmission of the votes. The primary channel used is through the public telecommunications networks and if that fails transmission will then be run through the satellite. Furthermore, a software called the Real-time Election Information System, reads the data and canvasses the votes. After the transmission from the PCOS machine, the ERs are transmitted to the central server, to a transparency server, and to the municipal board of canvassers (MBOC). Those three are the official servers declared by the administrators or officials of the elections. Moreover, the MBOC transmits it to the provincial board of canvassers (PBOC) where they consolidate and later transmit the results to the national board of canvassers (NBOC). Ad-ditionally, both the MBOC and PBOC sends ERs to the central servers.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">There was a special case in ARMM wherein they establish the regional board of canvassers (RBOC). The results for ARMM governor, vice governor, and assemblymen are tallied before being transmitted to the central server.</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">During the 2016 elections, congress will have their own server wherein the members of the senate and house of representatives can monitor the canvassing of the votes and to officially proclaim the winner for the national level.

====How can electoral fraud occur in the system?====
=====Lack of Digital Signature=====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">Digital Signatures serve two purposes during the elections. First, to ensure that the precinct election returns are not changed or modified throughout the election period. Also, this can help identify the BEI personnel in charge of the election returns as well as the precinct number it came from. However, based on a report by the Carter Center, the emphasized the absence of a personnel in charge of generating the public and private keys that should be used in the digital signatures as part of the transmission module for election returns in the automated election system. They had agreed that given the situation it has been one of the basic and fundamental system flaw that they’ve encountered. Apparently, the people administering the election abandoned the idea of implementing the digital signatures thus gaining a larger chance of having fraud during the elections. As prescribed in the RA 9369 Section 19 A, the digital signature is a vital part in maintaining the integrity and security of the election returns being transmitted. The law states that, “The election returns transmitted electronically and digitally signed shall be considered as official election results…”. With this, it can be inferred that the people behind the automated election system are not meeting the requirements needed thus violating the law.  Also, the results of the election generated by the automated election system is now being questioned with regard to its integrity. The automated election system’s ability to bring and conduct an election in the most effective and efficient way is currently being doubted by a mass of people.

=====Secret Servers=====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">During the 2016 elections, Bong Bong Marcos’ camp believes that there exists a “Fourth Server” or also known as the “Queue Server”. It has been revealed that the Comelec and Smartmatic has been keeping it from the public. Instead of letting the ERs be directly transmitted to the three official servers, namely the Municipal Board of Canvassing Server, Comelec Server, and the Transparency server, the results were first being processed and consolidated in the “Queue Server”. Another problem with the secret server is that the source code being used was never reviewed despite of it being a requirement in the law. Moreover, there were no poll watchers assigned for these servers making it questionable to both the public and the administrators. According to a statement made by Rodriguez, a representative of Marcos’ camp, the integrity of the 2016 May elections has been questioned be-cause of the unexpected situation made by the Comelec and Smartmatic. The ERs that were presented to the public did not come directly from the transparency server.  Alternatively, the results were first transmitted to a “Queue Server” where they were “consolidated and processed” and the “Queue Server” sends the data to the transparency servers which is against the law.

====HALALAN====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">University of the Philippines-Diliman implemented an automated voting for its local student university-wide elections. The voting system is known for its name “Halalan”. It does not utilize any paper ballots and is completely automated. The system was developed by the UP Linux Users Group (UnPLUG). The development started upon seeing the long paper ballots present in the university, thinking about the possibility of having an automated election system. The most notable feature of the Halalan system is the utilization of open source software. In order to run, it also needs network of computers connected to a web server and a database server. The voting that occurred in UP Diliman that started using the Halalan system begins in the following steps. A student goes to a precinct and presents his or her student ID. Once the ID is verified by the poll clerk, the voter is given a password from a listing of generated passwords. The voter goes to the computer and logs in his or her student number and the provided password. In the event of successfully logging in, an online ballot is displayed. The voter clicks on the boxed beside the names of the candidates and parties of their choice. The voter also has the choice to review his or her online ballot before submitting and confirming. The tallying of votes is continuously being accumulated until the end of the election. The Halalan system allows fast tabulation of votes if implemented accordingly. There is no need in spending hundreds of machined only designed for the purpose of reading a paper ballot. The expenses are devoted in buying personal computers or laptops that can be used for other purposes. The Halalan system may also encounter problems thus requiring a set of specific conditions. Highly stable computer network infrastructure should be present to ensure that all computers are connected to the central server at all times. There are also instances wherein the computer crashes and loses data. Another hurdle observed is the requirement that all voters must possess a degree of computer literacy in order to utilized electronic devices to its extent. (Reyes, 2010, par. 1-10).</p>

====PATAS====

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">The Commission on Elections (Comelec) held a mock election that utilizes its proposed hybrid election system known as Precinct Automation Tallying System or PATas at the Bacoor National High School. When using PATaS, voting is done manually and once the ballots are filled, it is then dropped in a ballot box. The counting of votes is also done manually by tallying. Augusto Lagman, an IT expert who proposed the idea of the hybrid election system, said that manual counting of the votes eliminates the possibility of result manipulation. "The problem with our current system — PCOS —  is that right from the first step, we don't know if they (the votes) are being counted correctly”, Lagman added. Moreover, the hybrid system will help the people avoid accidental and intentional errors during transmission. It can also lessen the number of invalid or rejected votes as shown in a comparison between the 2013 automated election and the 2010 manual elections.. In the 2013 automated elections, there were four million votes declared invalid compared to 2.1 million rejected votes in the 2010 manual elections. On the other hand, in PATaS the only automation part happens during the transmission of the total precinct count to the main servers. Lagman also claimed that by implementing the said system the government can cut down on the election system expenses. (Retrieved on April 12, 2016/ http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/06/27/Commission-on-Elections-Comelec-holds-mock-elections-tests-hybrid-system.html). </p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">However, The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has rejected the proposal for a hybrid manual and automated election system in the 2016 national polls. Christian Robert Lim, Comelec's senior commissioner, cited the following reasons: the PATAS will cost more compared to the optical mark reader (OMR) system, whether it is leased or purchased; PATAS will require amendment of existing laws or enactment of new laws; PATAS is time-consuming, taxing and prone to human error; and the PATAS software still needs to be developed. (Retrieved on April 12, 2016/ http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/07/09/15/why-comelec-rejected-lagmans-hybrid-voting-system).</p>

====TAPAT====
<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">TAPAT (Transparent Election System) was developed by Filipino IT group led by Edmundo Casiño, former president of the Philippine Computer Society (PCS), together with AES Watch. The alternative election system aims to make an election technology that is familiar to Filipino voters through the use of Lotto-type ballots. Moreover, a GPS-precinct-specific tablet will be used to scan and transmit the votes instead of the PCOS machines. However, after the said machine scans the ballot, it will issue a receipt called Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) that allows voters to double-check the votes that the machine read and the voters casted. According to the developers, TAPAT will only take a maximum 3 minutes per voter and will only cost around a billion pesos. (https://www.change.org/p/bill-endorsing-tapat-transparent-election-system-lotto-style-filipino-invented-automated-verifiable-voting-system-efficient-transparent-accountable-faster-better-and-cheaper-than-mexican-tech-smartmatic-pcos-for-2016-presidential-election?source_location=petitions_share_skip).</p>

<p style="text-indent:30px; text-align: justify">In 2015, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) tried the TAPAT voting system and was actually satisfied with the results except for the receipt issuance. They argued that this would only provoke voters to sell their votes but the IT group said that the VVPAT will be dropped by the voters together with the official ballots at the precinct. Due to time constraints however, the COMELEC thought it was a bit too late to integrate the system in the 2016 election but encouraged the developers to continue the improvements and tests for the promising election system.
